# hello-world
First Repository- Holder of Ideas and Notes

I am Shane and I'm somewhat new to programming. 

I only have experience with Java so far but after I feel more experienced, I would like to tackle Python and C++

My overall goal is working in Game Programming, I am currently working on some small arcade-like Android games.

For now, I am just happy to get any experience both individually and through collaborations!

Feel free to talk to me if you'd like.
